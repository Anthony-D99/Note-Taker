# Note-Taker 


## Description

This project can be used as a tool for user to store notes through a local server. The user can add, delete, and display notes by using this simple but effective web application.


## Installation

To install this project you must clone the repository then open the  main 'Develop' folder in the terminal and run it by typing and entering 'node server.js'. The terminal should notify you that the local host is listening and can be accessed by entering 'http://localhost:3001/' in the users desired browser.


## Usage

This application can be used by anyone and everyone to keep track of any notes that they deem necessary to keep track of. The user must first open the 'Develop' folder in the terminal and type 'node server.js'. Doing so will activate the users local database server and the user will now be able to access the webpage by going to their desired browser and searching 'http://localhost:3001/'. The user will then be presented with the home page where a 'Get Started' button will be present. By clicking the get started button the user will then be redirected to the '/notes' endpoint where they can access old notes, create new ones, and delete any current notes if the user chooses to do so.
